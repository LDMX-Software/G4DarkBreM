   * Constructor
   *
   * Configures this process by doing three main things:
   *  1. Registers this process with Geant4 as a 'fElectromagnetic' process
   *     - Needed for Geant4 Biasing Framework to recognize this process as
   *       "bias-able"
   *  2. Defines the EM subtype as one different from all other EM processes
   *     - Needed so we don't replace another EM process
   *  3. Decide on the model for dark bremming
   *
   * We add ourselves to the process table for muons (or electrons),
   * so the caller **does not** need to do this. Normally, this is done
   * in a physics constructor, but we have chosen to do this differently
   * to avoid mistakenly adding the dark brem process configured for muons
   * to the electron table (and vis-versa).

   *
   * We calculate the total cross section by calculating the total cross
   * section for each element in the current material and weighting
   * those cross sections by the number of atoms per volume in the material.
   * This allows the process to handle the material dependence on the cross
   * section, leaving the detailed elemental cross section calculation
   * to the model.
   *
   * The `global_bias` parameter from the constructor is also used
   * here after-the-calculation in order to allow rudimentary biasing.
   * The use of `global_bias` is discouraged in favor of using Geant4's
   * biasing infrastructure.

   * We maintain a cache for the cross sections calculated by the model
   * so that later in the run it is less likely that the model will
   * need to be called to calculate the cross section. This is done
   * in order to attempt to improve speed of simulation and avoid
